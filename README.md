Yes, we have officially leaked GGDev's 13.40 Launcher With more coming soon.<br>
Thanks to Edik for giving us their sources but he doesn't know we're leaking it
If any of the staff want this taken down you must make a issue on this github page
and we can POSSIBLY Talk something out.

Leaked by: FortniteSkids (https://github.com/FortniteSkids) :trollface:<br><br>

Please do not fall for skids like these, We are trying our best to delete most skids on the platform.
